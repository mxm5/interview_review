protected should be inherited as protected only
```java
class A  
{  
protected void msg()  
{  
System.out.println("Hello java A");  
}  
}  
public class Simple extends A {  
    @Override  
    protected void msg() {  
        System.out.println("nigger");  
    }  
  
    void msg2()  
{  
System.out.println("Hello java B");  
}  
//C.T.Error  
public static void main(String args[])  
{  
Simple obj=new Simple();  
obj.msg();  
}  
}
```
-   If in case, you create a subclass of some class, then the methods in that subclass cannot have less accessible access modifiers assigned to them than the superclass.
-   For instance, if a method in the superclass is _public_ then it must be public in the subclass too. If a method in the superclass is _protected,_ then it must be either protected or public in the specified subclass.
-   Methods declared as private are not inherited at all.
